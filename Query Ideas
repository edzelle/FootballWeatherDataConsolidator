Possible Query Ideas: 
Hypothesis - Teams that have stadiums in adverse climates will tend to outperform opponents when adverse weather impacts outdoor games

1. Home team win percentage when game is played below freezing or with snow in outdoor stadium
2. Home team win percentage when game is played above 90% humitiy in outdoor stadium
3. Home team win percentage when game is played below freezing or with snow in any stadium
4. Home team win percentage when game is played above 90% humitiy in any stadium
5. Home team win percentage when game is played with rain in outdoor stadium
6. Home team win percentage when game is played below freezing in outdoor stadium and opposing team home stadium resides in the south

Narrowing in on advantage of home team in outdoor games when opponent needs to deal with weather. There are three cases to look at:
	1. Low Temperature
	2. High Humiditiy 
	3. High temerature

What should the query output data look like?
	1. Initial query to set the stage

		Date, GameId, Home Team, Away Team, Tempurature, Snow, Apparent Temperature, Difference in lat between home stadiums, Home Team Wins?
		where game is played outdoors and apparent temerature is below freezing order by diff lat desc;
	2. Home Team Win Count, Total Games Count, Diff Lat
		where diff lat in (select distinct diff lat from query 1 round to some digit)
		and gameId in (select gameId where game is outdoor and apparent temp is below freezing)
		group by Diff lat;

	3. Similar to query 1 but with humidity above 90% order by temperature

	Number of games won by home team, number of games played,
